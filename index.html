        <p>The past years before the 2018-19 NBA season, the Toronto Raptors were a pretty average team in the NBA. They weren’t too exciting but had their fair share of superstars, such as Vince Carter, Chris Bosh, Demar DeRozan, and more. But after finding a new coach and getting a new superstar, Toronto achieved one of the best trophies in the NBA: The Larry O'Brien NBA Championship Trophy. This showed that Canada also has a really good basketball team up north and that they aren’t the average team they were before. </p>
